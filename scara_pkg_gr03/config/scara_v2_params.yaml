# ======================================
# This file contains parameters for the new trajectory planner and DXF exporter nodes.

# Usage:
#   ros2 run scara_pkg_gr03 scara_trajectory_planner_v2 --ros-args --params-file <path_to_this_file>

# Trajectory Planner V2 Parameters
scara_trajectory_planner_v2:
  ros__parameters:
    # Interpolation type: "linear", "cubic", or "quintic"
    # - linear: Simple straight-line interpolation (fastest, least smooth)
    # - cubic: Smooth interpolation with zero initial/final velocities
    # - quintic: Smoothest interpolation with zero initial/final velocities and accelerations
    interpolation_type: "linear"
    
    # Prismatic joint heights (mm)
    # safe_height: Z position for transitions between figures (tool is raised)
    # prismatic_down_height: Z position during path execution (tool is lowered)
    safe_height: 10.0
    prismatic_down_height: -5.0
    
    # Timing parameters (seconds)
    # time_work_segment: Duration for interpolating each work segment (line/arc)
    # time_segment_close: Duration for closing a figure (returning to start point)
    # time_prismatic_up: Duration for raising the prismatic joint
    # time_prismatic_down: Duration for lowering the prismatic joint
    # time_xy_transition: Duration for XY movement between different figures
    time_work_segment: 10.0
    time_segment_close: 2.0
    time_prismatic_up: 0.5
    time_prismatic_down: 0.5
    time_xy_transition: 2.0

    # Publishing parameters
    # publish_rate: Rate at which waypoints are published (Hz)
    # min_distance_mm: Minimum distance change (in mm) to publish a waypoint
    #                  This filters out redundant points that are too close together
    publish_rate: 60.0
    min_distance_mm: 0.1
    
    # Home position parameters (mm)
    # home_x: X coordinate for home position
    # home_y: Y coordinate for home position
    # Robot will move to this position with tool up (safe_height) at the end
    home_x: 303.0
    home_y: 0.0
    
    # Initial positioning
    # initial_position_repeats: Number of times to send the first position
    #                           This ensures the robot reaches the starting position
    initial_position_repeats: 300

# DXF Exporter V2 Parameters
dxf_exporter_node_v2:
  ros__parameters:
    # DXF file to parse
    # Can be either:
    # 1. Absolute path: "/home/user/path/to/file.dxf"
    # 2. Relative to package share: "filename.dxf" (looks in install/share/scara_pkg_gr03/dxf/)
    dxf_file: "Circulo_r5.dxf"
    
    # Workspace centering parameters (mm)
    # The DXF geometric center will be moved to this location in the robot workspace
    # workspace_center_x: Target X coordinate for the piece center
    # workspace_center_y: Target Y coordinate for the piece center
    workspace_center_x: 250.0
    workspace_center_y: -40.0
    
    # Scale factor
    # 1.0 = 100% (original size)
    # 0.5 = 50% (half size)
    # 2.0 = 200% (double size)
    # Scaling is applied relative to the geometric center before translation
    scale: 2.0

# Example configurations for different use cases:
# ================================================

#     time_segment_close: 2.0
#     time_xy_transition: 3.0
#     publish_rate: 10.0
#     min_distance_mm: 2.0

# High quality (longer times, smoother motion):
# scara_trajectory_planner_v2:
#   ros__parameters:
#     interpolation_type: "quintic"
#     time_work_segment: 30.0
#     time_segment_close: 30.0
